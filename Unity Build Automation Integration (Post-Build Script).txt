Unity Build Automation Integration (Post-Build Script)
Create a Post-Build Script in Unity:
In the Unity project, go to Assets/Editor/.
Create a new C# script named PostBuildScript.cs and add the following code:
csharp
Copy code
using UnityEditor;
using UnityEditor.Build;
using UnityEditor.Build.Reporting;
using System.IO;

public class PostBuildScript : IPostprocessBuildWithReport
{
    public int callbackOrder => 1;

    public void OnPostprocessBuild(BuildReport report)
    {
        // Get the build output path
        string buildPath = report.summary.outputPath;

        // Define the ABOUT.txt file path
        string aboutFilePath = Path.Combine(buildPath, "ABOUT.txt");

        // Create the content for the ABOUT file
        string aboutContent = "ZaXodos\n" +
                             "Copyright © 2024 88th Capital and Business Solutions (PTY) Ltd.\n" +
                             "All rights reserved.\n\n" +
                             "Unauthorized reproduction, distribution, or modification of this software\n" +
                             "or its documentation is strictly prohibited.\n\n" +
                             "Contact:\n" +
                             "Email: maseti.oss@outlook.com\n" +
                             "Phone: +27 62 344 3846\n" +
                             "Address: 937 Sompunzi Street, Ginsberg Loc, King William's Town (Qonce) 5601, South Africa.";

        // Write the ABOUT.txt file into the build directory
        File.WriteAllText(aboutFilePath, aboutContent);

        // Log to confirm file creation
        Debug.Log("ABOUT.txt file added to build: " + aboutFilePath);
    }
}
How to Use:

When you build your Unity project, this script will automatically append an ABOUT.txt file with your copyright information to the build output folder.
Testing:

Build your project, and after completion, check the build directory for the ABOUT.txt file to ensure it’s being added automatically.
