Solution 1: Unity Build Automation
For Unity, we can automate appending the copyright or ABOUT.txt file during the build process using Post-Build Scripts. This ensures that the file is added automatically when building the game.

Steps:
Create a Post-Build Script in Unity:

Navigate to Assets/Editor and create a C# script called PostBuildScript.cs.
Add the Following Code:

csharp
Copy code
using UnityEditor;
using UnityEditor.Build;
using UnityEditor.Build.Reporting;
using System.IO;

public class PostBuildScript : IPostprocessBuildWithReport
{
    public int callbackOrder => 1;

    public void OnPostprocessBuild(BuildReport report)
    {
        // Get the build output path
        string buildPath = report.summary.outputPath;

        // Define the ABOUT.txt file path
        string aboutFilePath = Path.Combine(buildPath, "ABOUT.txt");

        // Create the content for the ABOUT file
        string aboutContent = "ZaXodos\n" +
                              "Copyright © 2024 88th Capital and Business Solutions (PTY) Ltd.\n" +
                              "All rights reserved.\n\n" +
                              "Unauthorized reproduction, distribution, or modification of this software\n" +
                              "or its documentation is strictly prohibited.\n\n" +
                              "Contact:\n" +
                              "Email: maseti.oss@outlook.com\n" +
                              "Phone: +27 62 344 3846\n" +
                              "Address: 937 Sompunzi Street, Ginsberg Loc, King William's Town (Qonce) 5601, South Africa.";

        // Write the ABOUT.txt file into the build directory
        File.WriteAllText(aboutFilePath, aboutContent);

        // Log to confirm file creation
        Debug.Log("ABOUT.txt file added to build: " + aboutFilePath);
    }
}
How It Works:

When you build your project, this script will automatically add an ABOUT.txt file to your build output folder.
The file will contain the copyright information, contact details, and the legal notice.
Solution 2: GitHub Actions for CI/CD Pipeline
GitHub Actions is a great way to automate your build process with CI/CD. Below is an example of how to automate appending the copyright file during your build process using a GitHub Actions workflow.

Steps:
Create the GitHub Actions Workflow File:

Create a .github/workflows/build.yml file in your repository.
Add the Following Workflow Code:

yaml
Copy code
name: Build Game

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout Code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Setup Unity
      uses: game-ci/unity-builder@v2
      with:
        unityVersion: 2023.1.5f1  # Replace with your Unity version

    - name: Build Game
      uses: game-ci/unity-builder@v2
      with:
        projectPath: .
        buildTarget: StandaloneWindows64
        outputPath: ./Builds/GameBuild

    - name: Add ABOUT File to Build
      run: |
        echo "ZaXodos" > ./Builds/GameBuild/ABOUT.txt
        echo "Copyright © 2024 88th Capital and Business Solutions (PTY) Ltd." >> ./Builds/GameBuild/ABOUT.txt
        echo "All rights reserved." >> ./Builds/GameBuild/ABOUT.txt
        echo "" >> ./Builds/GameBuild/ABOUT.txt
        echo "Unauthorized reproduction, distribution, or modification of this software" >> ./Builds/GameBuild/ABOUT.txt
        echo "or its documentation is strictly prohibited." >> ./Builds/GameBuild/ABOUT.txt
        echo "" >> ./Builds/GameBuild/ABOUT.txt
        echo "Contact:" >> ./Builds/GameBuild/ABOUT.txt
        echo "Email: maseti.oss@outlook.com" >> ./Builds/GameBuild/ABOUT.txt
        echo "Phone: +27 62 344 3846" >> ./Builds/GameBuild/ABOUT.txt
        echo "Address: 937 Sompunzi Street, Ginsberg Loc, King William's Town (Qonce) 5601, South Africa." >> ./Builds/GameBuild/ABOUT.txt

    - name: Upload Build Artifact
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: ZaXodos-Build
        path: ./Builds/GameBuild
How It Works:

When a commit is pushed to the main branch, the workflow will trigger.
It will run the build process and create the game build in the specified directory (./Builds/GameBuild).
After building, the ABOUT.txt file is added automatically to the build directory.
Finally, the build is uploaded as an artifact for download or distribution.
Solution 3: Custom Post-Build Bash Script
If you're working in a non-Unity or non-Unreal environment, you can create a custom bash or Python script to automate adding the copyright file to your build output.

Bash Script:
bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash

# Define your build directory
BUILD_DIR="./Builds/GameBuild"
ABOUT_FILE="$BUILD_DIR/ABOUT.txt"

# Create the build directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p $BUILD_DIR

# Add the ABOUT file
cat <<EOT > $ABOUT_FILE
ZaXodos

EOT

echo "ABOUT file added to build: $ABOUT_FILE"
How It Works:
After your build process completes, run this bash script to automatically append the ABOUT.txt file to the build folder.
It will create the file with all the necessary copyright information.
Solution 4: Unreal Engine Python Script
For Unreal Engine, you can automate the process using Python after the build completes.

Python Script:
python
Copy code
import os

def write_about_file(build_directory):
    about_file_path = os.path.join(build_directory, "ABOUT.txt")
    with open(about_file_path, "w") as file:
        file.write("ZaXodos\n")
        file.write("Copyright © 2024 88th Capital and Business Solutions (PTY) Ltd.\n")
        file.write("All rights reserved.\n\n")
        file.write("Unauthorized reproduction, distribution, or modification of this software\n")
        file.write("or its documentation is strictly prohibited.\n\n")
        file.write("Contact:\n")
        file.write("Email: maseti.oss@outlook.com\n")
        file.write("Phone: +27 62 344 3846\n")
        file.write("Address: 937 Sompunzi Street, Ginsberg Loc, King William's Town (Qonce) 5601, South Africa.\n")

# Replace this with your actual build output directory
build_output_directory = "C:/Your/Build/Output/Directory"
write_about_file(build_output_directory)
How It Works:
The script writes the ABOUT.txt file to the directory specified.
You can run this script after the Unreal Engine build process completes.
Conclusion
Unity: Use a PostBuildScript to add the copyright file after building.
GitHub Actions: Automate builds with CI/CD and add the copyright file.
Custom Script (Bash/Python): Create simple scripts for non-game engine workflows to append the copyright file.
