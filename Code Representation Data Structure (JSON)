Interactive Script (Python)

import json

# Load data
with open('historical_acts.json', 'r') as file:
    historical_acts = json.load(file)

# Function to display act details
def display_act_details(act):

Implementation Notes
JSON File: Save the data in a JSON file (historical_acts.json) for scalability and easier integration into other systems.
Interactive Viewer: The Python script lets users explore each act interactively, making it suitable for an educational tool or game.
Future Enhancements: Include visualizations (graphs or timelines) using libraries like Matplotlib or D3.js for web integration.
This structure ensures flexibility, interactivity, and clarity for presenting complex historical narratives.
