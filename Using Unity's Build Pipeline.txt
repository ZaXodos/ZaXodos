1. Using Unity's Build Pipeline
In Unity, you can modify the build pipeline using BuildPlayerOptions or add a post-build script to include a file like ABOUT.txt or LICENSE.txt in the final build directory.

Unity Post-Build Script Example:

csharp
Copy code
using UnityEditor;
using UnityEditor.Build;
using UnityEditor.Build.Reporting;
using System.IO;

public class PostBuildScript : IPostprocessBuildWithReport
{
    public int callbackOrder => 1;

    public void OnPostprocessBuild(BuildReport report)
    {
        string buildPath = report.summary.outputPath;
        string aboutFilePath = Path.Combine(buildPath, "ABOUT.txt");

        string aboutContent = "ZaXodos\n" +
                              "Copyright © 2024 88th Capital and Business Solutions (PTY) Ltd.\n" +
                              "All rights reserved.\n\n" +
                              "Unauthorized reproduction, distribution, or modification of this software\n" +
                              "or its documentation is strictly prohibited.\n\n" +
                              "Contact:\n" +
                              "Email: maseti.oss@outlook.com\n" +
                              "Phone: +27 62 344 3846\n" +
                              "Address: 937 Sompunzi Street, Ginsberg Loc, King William's Town (Qonce) 5601, South Africa.";

        // Write the ABOUT file into the build directory
        File.WriteAllText(aboutFilePath, aboutContent);
        Debug.Log("ABOUT.txt file added to build: " + aboutFilePath);
    }
}
Save this script in the Assets/Editor folder of your Unity project.
Every time you build the game, an ABOUT.txt file will be added to the build directory.
2. Using a CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions Example)
You can use a CI tool like GitHub Actions to automate appending the ABOUT file during the build process.

GitHub Actions Workflow Example (.github/workflows/build.yml):

yaml
Copy code
name: Build Game

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout Code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Setup Unity
      uses: game-ci/unity-builder@v2
      with:
        unityVersion: 2023.1.5f1  # Replace with your Unity version

    - name: Build Game
      uses: game-ci/unity-builder@v2
      with:
        projectPath: .
        buildTarget: StandaloneWindows64
        outputPath: ./Builds/GameBuild

    - name: Add ABOUT File to Build
      run: |
        echo "ZaXodos" > ./Builds/GameBuild/ABOUT.txt
        echo "Copyright © 2024 88th Capital and Business Solutions (PTY) Ltd." >> ./Builds/GameBuild/ABOUT.txt
        echo "All rights reserved." >> ./Builds/GameBuild/ABOUT.txt
        echo "" >> ./Builds/GameBuild/ABOUT.txt
        echo "Unauthorized reproduction, distribution, or modification of this software" >> ./Builds/GameBuild/ABOUT.txt
        echo "or its documentation is strictly prohibited." >> ./Builds/GameBuild/ABOUT.txt
        echo "" >> ./Builds/GameBuild/ABOUT.txt
        echo "Contact:" >> ./Builds/GameBuild/ABOUT.txt
        echo "Email: maseti.oss@outlook.com" >> ./Builds/GameBuild/ABOUT.txt
        echo "Phone: +27 62 344 3846" >> ./Builds/GameBuild/ABOUT.txt
        echo "Address: 937 Sompunzi Street, Ginsberg Loc, King William's Town (Qonce) 5601, South Africa." >> ./Builds/GameBuild/ABOUT.txt

    - name: Upload Build Artifact
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: ZaXodos-Build
        path: ./Builds/GameBuild
3. Adding to Unreal Engine Build Scripts
Unreal Engine projects can use the PostBuildStep feature in the .uproject file or a custom Python script.

Example Unreal Post-Build Script in Python:

python
Copy code
import os

def write_about_file(build_directory):
    about_file_path = os.path.join(build_directory, "ABOUT.txt")
    with open(about_file_path, "w") as file:
        file.write("ZaXodos\n")
        file.write("Copyright © 2024 88th Capital and Business Solutions (PTY) Ltd.\n")
        file.write("All rights reserved.\n\n")
        file.write("Unauthorized reproduction, distribution, or modification of this software\n")
        file.write("or its documentation is strictly prohibited.\n\n")
        file.write("Contact:\n")
        file.write("Email: maseti.oss@outlook.com\n")
        file.write("Phone: +27 62 344 3846\n")
        file.write("Address: 937 Sompunzi Street, Ginsberg Loc, King William's Town (Qonce) 5601, South Africa.\n")

# Replace this with your actual build output directory
build_output_directory = "C:/Your/Build/Output/Directory"
write_about_file(build_output_directory)
Add this script to your build pipeline, typically in a post-build event or as part of automation tools like Jenkins.
4. General Bash Script for Build Automation
For simpler projects or custom builds:

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash

BUILD_DIR="./Builds/GameBuild"
ABOUT_FILE="$BUILD_DIR/ABOUT.txt"

# Create the build directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p $BUILD_DIR

# Add the ABOUT file
cat <<EOT > $ABOUT_FILE

echo "ABOUT file added to build: $ABOUT_FILE"
Run this script after your build process to include the ABOUT file in your final output directory.
