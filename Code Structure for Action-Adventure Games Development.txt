Focusing on action and adventure genres in games or historical storytelling. 
-Adapt the structure to emphasize these elements. 
The structure for both game development requirements and historical themes.

# Define action-adventure game requirements
action_adventure_game = {
    "Core Elements": {
        "Gameplay": [
            "Dynamic combat mechanics (e.g., melee, ranged, stealth)",
            "Exploration of vast, immersive environments",
            "Challenging puzzles and quests"
        ],
        "Storytelling": [
            "Engaging narrative with emotional depth",

# Function to display game development requirements
def display_game_requirements(game):
    for category, details in game.items():
        print(f"{category}:")
        for subcategory, items in details.items():
            print(f"  {subcategory}:")

Code Structure for Historical Action-Adventure Themes
If you're designing a historical action-adventure game or story inspired by real events, you can use this structure:

python
Copy code
# Define historical settings with action-adventure focus
historical_action_adventure = {
    "Time Periods": {
        "Ancient and Classical": [
            {"era": "Ancient Egypt", "themes": "Tomb exploration, pharaoh conspiracies"},
            {"era": "Roman Empire", "themes": "Gladiator battles, political intrigue"}
        ],
        "Medieval": [
            {"era": "Feudal Japan", "themes": "Samurai honor, ninja stealth missions"},
            {"era": "European Crusades", "themes": "Knightly quests, holy wars"}
        ],
        "Modern": [
            {"era": "World War II", "themes": "Espionage, resistance movements"},
            {"era": "Cold War", "themes": "Spy thrillers, covert operations"}
        ]
    },
    "Core Mechanics": {
        "Combat": ["Swordplay", "Archery", "Stealth takedowns"],
        "Exploration": ["Open-world maps", "Hidden treasure hunting"],
        "Story": ["Historical accuracy with fictional twists", "Protagonist personal struggles"]
    },
    "Inspirations": [
        "Assassin's Creed series",
        "Tomb Raider",
        "Uncharted"
    ]
}

# Function to display historical themes
def display_historical_themes(themes):
    for category, details in themes.items():
        print(f"{category}:")
        if isinstance(details, list):
            for item in details:
                if isinstance(item, dict):
                    print(f"  - {item['era']}: {item['themes']}")
                else:
                    print(f"  - {item}")
        elif isinstance(details, dict):
            for subcategory, items in details.items():
                print(f"  {subcategory}:")
                for item in items:
                    print(f"    - {item}")
        print()  # Blank line for readability
