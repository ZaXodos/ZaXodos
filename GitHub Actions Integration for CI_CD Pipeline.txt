GitHub Actions Integration for CI/CD Pipeline
If you're using GitHub Actions to automate the build process, you can integrate the solution I provided by setting up a workflow YAML file.

Create a GitHub Actions Workflow:

In your repository, create a file at .github/workflows/build.yml.
Workflow Code:

yaml
Copy code
name: Build Game

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout Code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Setup Unity
      uses: game-ci/unity-builder@v2
      with:
        unityVersion: 2023.1.5f1  # Replace with your Unity version

    - name: Build Game
      uses: game-ci/unity-builder@v2
      with:
        projectPath: .
        buildTarget: StandaloneWindows64
        outputPath: ./Builds/GameBuild

    - name: Add ABOUT File to Build
      run: |
        echo "ZaXodos" > ./Builds/GameBuild/ABOUT.txt
        echo "Copyright Â© 2024 88th Capital and Business Solutions (PTY) Ltd." >> ./Builds/GameBuild/ABOUT.txt
        echo "All rights reserved." >> ./Builds/GameBuild/ABOUT.txt
        echo "" >> ./Builds/GameBuild/ABOUT.txt
        echo "Unauthorized reproduction, distribution, or modification of this software" >> ./Builds/GameBuild/ABOUT.txt
        echo "or its documentation is strictly prohibited." >> ./Builds/GameBuild/ABOUT.txt
        echo "" >> ./Builds/GameBuild/ABOUT.txt
        echo "Contact:" >> ./Builds/GameBuild/ABOUT.txt
        echo "Email: maseti.oss@outlook.com" >> ./Builds/GameBuild/ABOUT.txt
        echo "Phone: +27 62 344 3846" >> ./Builds/GameBuild/ABOUT.txt
        echo "Address: 937 Sompunzi Street, Ginsberg Loc, King William's Town (Qonce) 5601, South Africa." >> ./Builds/GameBuild/ABOUT.txt

    - name: Upload Build Artifact
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: ZaXodos-Build
        path: ./Builds/GameBuild
How to Use:

When you push changes to the main branch, GitHub Actions will build the project, append the ABOUT.txt file, and upload the build artifact.
The file will contain your copyright information, contact details, and legal notices.
Testing:

Trigger the workflow by pushing changes to your GitHub repository.
After the build completes, verify the ABOUT.txt is included in the uploaded artifact.
