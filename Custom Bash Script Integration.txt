Custom Bash Script Integration
Create a Bash Script:

Create a file add_about_file.sh in your project folder.
Bash Script Code:

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash

# Define your build directory
BUILD_DIR="./Builds/GameBuild"
ABOUT_FILE="$BUILD_DIR/ABOUT.txt"

echo "ABOUT file added to build: $ABOUT_FILE"
How to Use:

After you build your game (or after your build system finishes), run this bash script to add the ABOUT.txt file with the appropriate legal and contact details.
Testing:

Run the script after your build process to confirm that the ABOUT.txt file is being added to your build output directory.
Unreal Engine Python Script Integration
Python Script Setup:
Save the following Python script as add_about_file.py in your project directory.
python
Copy code
import os

def write_about_file(build_directory):
    about_file_path = os.path.join(build_directory, "ABOUT.txt")
    with open(about_file_path, "w") as file:
        file.write("ZaXodos\n")
        file.write("Copyright © 2024 88th Capital and Business Solutions (PTY) Ltd.\n")
        file.write("All rights reserved.\n\n")
        file.write("Unauthorized reproduction, distribution, or modification of this software\n")
        file.write("or its documentation is strictly prohibited.\n\n")
        file.write("Contact:\n")
        file.write("Email: maseti.oss@outlook.com\n")
        file.write("Phone: +27 62 344 3846\n")
        file.write("Address: 937 Sompunzi Street, Ginsberg Loc, King William's Town (Qonce) 5601, South Africa.\n")

# Replace this with your actual build output directory
build_output_directory = "C:/Your/Build/Output/Directory"
write_about_file(build_output_directory)
How to Use:

After building your project in Unreal Engine, run this Python script to automatically add the ABOUT.txt file to your build output.
Testing:

Run the Python script after your Unreal Engine build finishes to verify the ABOUT.txt file is created in the specified directory.
Conclusion
By integrating any of these solutions into your workflow, you can automate the addition of the ABOUT.txt file containing the copyright information and legal notice. Depending on your setup (Unity, GitHub Actions, Bash, or Unreal Engine), follow the instructions to add this process to your build pipeline.
